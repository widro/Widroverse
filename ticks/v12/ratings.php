<i>Every week, the Inside Pulse Ratings Report takes a look at the latest TV ratings for all major wrestling shows in the United States. For each show, the latest ratings are analyzed, and compared with the last 5 and 10 week trends. </i>

Hey everyone and welcome to an all new feature at Inside Pulse Wrestling - the weekly Wrestling Ratings Report or the WRR.

With Wrestlemania right around the corner, now is the perfect time to take a look not only at WWE ratings, but all the major shows in the United States wrestling TV landscape.
